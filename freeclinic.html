                <h3>I volunteer as a HIV Intervention Specialist</h3>

                <p id=volunteer> Although I have recently began this experience, I have learned a great deal regarding being understanding and non-judgmental. This opportunity offers me the ability to have a generous amount of one on one patient contact and counsel a diverse population. Counseling and testing patients for HIV and/or Hepatitis C continuously raises my awareness of the experiences and obstacles others can face. As I continue with this weekly volunteer experience, I aspire to learn from the people I am serving and strengthen my capabilities to be professional, relatable, compassionate, aware that anyone can be in a similar situation, including myself, and sympathize with those who are in an extraordinarily vulnerable situation looking for compassion.
