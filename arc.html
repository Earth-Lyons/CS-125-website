                <h3>I volunteer as a Blood Drive Coordinator</h3>

                <p id=volunteer> I coordinate and host American Red Cross blood drives twice a year, in the summer and winter. In doing so, I am responsible for maintaining relations with the American Red Cross area coordinator and the blood drive site that I am accountable for locating and scheduling for the drive, scheduling and maintaining donors while forming a team to assist in the process, and building a rapport with the blood drive site. As a result, I have and will continue to host blood drives at that specific site. I especially excel in the perseverance of this volunteer experience because there is a great deal of effort in trying to recruit donors and despite not always achieving the desired result, it is an invaluable opportunity that in the end helps those who need blood as a life-saving product.
