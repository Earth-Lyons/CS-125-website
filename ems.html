                <p id=volunteer> I am excited to begin as a member on such a integral team!<br><br>
                    While I have not began on the official JCU EMS Squad, I am currently working towards my EMT Certification and practicing for the National Registry Exam. JCU EMS was one of the first university involvement groups that I took an interest in and immediately inquired about joining. <br><br>
                    I am looking forward to helping my fellow John Carroll University peers and receive applicable and genuine medical experience!
